# Challenge Description
Injector is a Windows Forensics  challenge on cyberdefenders.org and we can find it [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/32) 

**Case Overview**: The SOC team got an alert regarding some illegal port scanning activity coming from an employee's system. The employee was not authorized to do any port scanning or any offensive hacking activity within the network. The employee claimed that he had no idea about that, and it is probably a malware acting on his behalf. The IR team managed to respond immediately and take a full forensic image of the user's system to perform some investigations.

There is a theory that the user intentionally installed illegal applications to do port scanning and maybe other things. He was probably planning for something bigger, far beyond a port scanning!

It all began when the user asked for a salary raise that was rejected. After that, his behavior was abnormal and different. The suspect is believed to have weak technical skills, and there might be an outsider helping him!

Our objective is to analyze the image and to either confirm or deny this theory.

# Challenge Questions walkthrough

1. **What is the computer name of the suspect machine?**

   We can git the Computer name from **Registry Hives**

   First we have to get the ***Registry Hives*** from `\Windows\System32\config` and to get the computer name,  we will parse the ***SYSTEM registry hive*** through Registry Explorer tool.

   To get the Computer name we will follow   ***SYSTEM*** &rarr;   ***ControlSet001*** &rarr;   ***Control*** &rarr;   ***ComputerName***  &rarr;   ***ComputerName*** 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q1.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q1.png)

   The answer is: **4ORENSICS**

2. **What is the computer IP?**

   Also From the ***SYSTEM registry hive*** we can get the IP address from the following path: 

    ***SYSTEM*** &rarr;   ***ControlSet001*** &rarr;   ***Services*** &rarr;   ***Tcpip***  &rarr;   ***Interfaces*** 

   and here we will find Three different interfaces the **{8CB9FBF6-AE23-4E1C-AA0A-EE23CB4FE736}** is the one which have the Network info 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q2.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q2.png)

   The answer is: **10.0.2.15**

3. **What was the DHCP LeaseObtainedTime?**

   From the Same last Path in Question 3 we can see the **LeaseObtainedTime** data value 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q3.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q3.png)

   and here what to do is to take the value data and convert it using any tool or online convertor to Convert epoch to human-readable date

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q3-p2.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q3-p2.png)

   The answer is: **21/06/2016 02:24:12 UTC**

4. **What is the computer SID?**

   We can find the **computer SID** from **SAM** from the following 

     ***SAM*** &rarr;   ***Domains*** &rarr;   ***Account*** &rarr;   ***Aliases***  &rarr;   ***Members*** 

   and we found two Keys and we know that the machine SID prefix **S-1-5-21** so it will be the first key value

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q4.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q4.png)

   The answer is: **S-1-5-21-2489440558-2754304563-710705792**

5. **What is the Operating System(OS) version?**

   from **SOFTWARE  registry hive** we can find the OS version when we go to: 

     ***SOFTWARE*** &rarr;   ***Microsoft*** &rarr;   ***Windows NT*** &rarr;   ***CurrentVersion***   

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5.png)

   Also that kind of information can be found in License file be simply go to `\Windows\System32\license.rtf` and when we search google about the version part that we not understand we got the answer 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5-p2.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5-p2.png)

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5-p3.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q5-p3.png)

   The answer is: **8.1**

6. **What was the computer timezone?**

   in the ***Registry artifacts*** and checking the ***SYSTEM registry hive*** we will find the timezone in:

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q6.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q6.png)

   The answer is: **UTC-07:0**

7. **How many times did this user log on to the computer?**

   here we only need to analyze the **SAM  registry hive** using RegRipper and we got the answer

     [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q9.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q9.png)

   and to get information about the running program we need to see the **prefetch** and analyze it using **PECmd** 

    ```powershell
    PS D:\CyberDefender> .\PECmd.exe -f 'E:\Windows\Prefetch\ZENMAP.EXE-56B17C4C.pf'
    ```

   I got the Last running time

    Like Question 9 we will also use **PEcmd** and we will have the number of the prefetch files

    ```powershell
    PS D:\CyberDefender> .\PECmd.exe -d E:\Windows\Prefetch\
    *********************************************************
    Processed 174 out of 174 files in 5.3405 seconds
    ```

    The answer is: **174**

23. **How many times was the file shredder application executed?**

    as the last Question we will also use **PEcmd** to analyze the prefetch  file 

    ```powershell
    PS D:\CyberDefender> .\PECmd.exe -f E:\Windows\Prefetch\BCWIPE.EXE-36F3F2DF.pf
    ```

      [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q23.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q23.png)

25. **A JAR file for an offensive traffic manipulation tool was executed. What is the absolute path of the file?**

    here when I see the lnk files using FTK imager I notice that most of them have deleted mark so I recover Them using R-studio 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q25.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q25.png)

    and I noticed the Jar file and it's a burb suite and using LEcmd tool I know info like file path 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q25-p2.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q25-p2.png)

26. **The suspect employee tried to exfiltrate data by sending it as an email attachment. What is the name of the suspected attachment?**

    Like what we done in Question 17 we will search in the Outlook Backup file also and we will find the **name of the suspected attachment** 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q26.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q26.png)

    The answer is: **Pictures.7z**

27. **Shellbags shows that the employee created a folder to include all the data he will exfiltrate. What is the full path of that folder?**

    The answer is: **C:\Users\Hunter\Pictures\Exfil**

28. **The user deleted two JPG files from the system and moved them to $Recycle-Bin. What is the file name that has the resolution of 1920x1200?**

    Here when I go to see the `$Recycle.Bin\` content I found two Images Start with **$R** which mean this holds the “meat” or the true content of the file so when I see the displayed Part I Notice that it's Such as The ws_Small_cute_kitty_1920x1200.jpg pic in the **`[root]\Users\Hunter\Picture\Private`** 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q28.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q28.png)

29. **Provide the name of the directory where information about jump lists items (created automatically by the system) is stored?**

    This one is a general info about Jump List.

    **Jump lists** are lists of recently opened items, such as files, folders, or websites, organized by the program that you use to open them, They contain information about recently accessed applications and files.

    The answer is: **AutomaticDestinations-ms**

30. **Using JUMP LIST analysis, provide the full path of the application with the AppID of "aa28770954eaeaaa" used to bypass network security monitoring controls.**

    We can find the JUMP LIST in **`[root]\Users\hunter\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations`** 

    and also there are custom-made jump lists can be found in 

    **`[root]\Users\hunter\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations`** 

    and when I load both of them in JumpList Explorer tool we can find info about the **AppID of "aa28770954eaeaaa"** used to bypass network security monitoring controls 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q30.png)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Hunter/Q30.png)
